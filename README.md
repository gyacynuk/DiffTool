# Text Comparison Tool
An implementation of a text comparison tool, which is based off of an original adaptation of the Wagner-Fischer dynamic programming algorithm for computing edit distance.

Furthermore I've used this project to make my first foray into React, developing a Github-styled user interface to showcase the algorithm.
